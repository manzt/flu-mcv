Setup & Installation
---
To create visualizations with Altair, you must have the Altair package and a frontend renderer (ie. JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or Colab). Specific installation instructions are described in the [Altair documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html) for each of these renderers. This notebook was created in JupyterLab.
